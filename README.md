# Analyzing-failed-taxi-orders
This project analyzes failed ride-hailing orders from Gett to uncover key patterns and insights. The goal is to investigate failure trends, identify peak failure times, and understand the impact of estimated arrival times on order success.
Key Objectives
Failure Analysis: Categorize and visualize the distribution of failed orders by different failure reasons.
Time-Based Trends: Analyze hourly patterns in failed orders and identify peak failure periods.
Cancellation Insights: Compare the average time to cancellation with and without driver assignment.
ETA Distribution: Examine the distribution of estimated arrival times (ETA) and its potential impact on order failures.
Technologies Used
Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Geospatial Analysis: h3, Folium
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration
This project was inspired by a take-home assignment for a data science role at Gett and demonstrates real-world applications of data analysis in the ride-hailing industry. ðŸš–ðŸ“Š
