# Analyzing-failed-taxi-orders
This project analyzes failed ride-hailing orders from Gett to uncover key patterns and insights. The dataset includes customer ride requests that were not successfully completed due to cancellations, driver rejections, or other reasons. The goal is to investigate failure trends, identify peak failure times, and understand the impact of estimated arrival times on order success.
